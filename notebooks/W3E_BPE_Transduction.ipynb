    "The [Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/quicktour.html) library by Huggingface provides implementations of today’s most used tokenizers (especially subword-based ones) that is both easy to use and blazing fast (Rust-compiled code!).\n",

Finally, you will be asked to train a small transformer model to perform transduction from feminine to masculine words.\n",
