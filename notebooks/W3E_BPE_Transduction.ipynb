    "The [Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/quicktour.html) library by Huggingface provides implementations of todayâ€™s most used tokenizers (especially subword-based ones) that is both easy to use and blazing fast (Rust-compiled code!).\n",

    "You will start by exploring the impact of different vocabulary sizes on a subword tokenizer using the Tokenizers library, and how these can be imported and used with spaCy. Finally, you will be asked to train a small transformer model to perform transduction from feminine to masculine words.\n",
