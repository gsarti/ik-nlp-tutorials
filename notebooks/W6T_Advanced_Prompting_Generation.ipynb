In other words, LLMs should have *agency*.

The influence of the LLM’s input on the code workflow is the level of agency of LLMs in the system.\n","\n","Note that with this definition, “agent” is not a discrete, 0 or 1 definition: instead, “agency” evolves on a continuous spectrum, as you give more or less power to the LLM on your workflow.\n","\n","This agentic system runs in a loop, executing a new action at each step (the action can involve calling some pre-determined tools), until its observations make it apparent that a satisfactory state has been reached to solve the given task.

The question is: do I really need flexibility in the workflow to efficiently solve the task at hand? If the pre-determined workflow falls short too often, that means you need more flexibility. Let’s take an example: say you’re making an app that handles customer requests on a surfing trip website.\n","\n","You could know in advance that the requests will belong to either of 2 buckets (based on user choice), and you have a predefined workflow for each of these 2 cases.\n","\n","1. Want some knowledge on the trips? ⇒ give them access to a search bar to search your knowledge base\n","2. Wants to talk to sales? ⇒ let them type in a contact form.\n","\n","If that deterministic workflow fits all queries, by all means just code everything! This will give you a 100% reliable system with no risk of error introduced by letting unpredictable LLMs meddle in your workflow. For the sake of simplicity and robustness, it’s advised to regularize towards not using any agentic behaviour.\n","\n","But what if the workflow can’t be determined that well in advance?\n","\n","For instance, a user wants to ask:\n","\n","> \"I can come on Monday, but I forgot my passport so risk being delayed to Wednesday, is it possible to take me and my stuff to surf on Tuesday morning, with a cancellation insurance?\"\n","\n","This question hinges on many factors, and probably none of the predetermined criteria above will suffice for this request.\n","\n","If the pre-determined workflow falls short too often, that means you need more flexibility.\n","\n","That is where an agentic setup helps.\n","\n","In the above example, you could just make a multi-step agent that has access to a weather API for weather forecasts, Google Maps API to compute travel distance, an employee availability dashboard and a RAG system on your knowledge base.\n","\n","Until recently, computer programs were restricted to pre-determined workflows, trying to handle complexity by piling up if/else switches. They focused on extremely narrow tasks, like “compute the sum of these numbers” or “find the shortest path in this graph”. But actually, most real-life tasks, like our trip example above, do not fit in pre-determined workflows.
