In this exercise, you will reproduce a standard machine learning pipeline integrating text and non-textual information. Importantly, while in the previous tutorials and exercises we focused on the usage of advanced tooling such as the Transformers library, here we will start from the basics to establish some baseline results using the popular [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) library. \n",

A strength of linear models is that they're highly interpretable: the coefficient assigned to each feature expresses the importance of the said feature in determining the predicted target. For example, a vectorized word having a large positive coefficient given by the trained regression model entails a large predicted quality score for the wine."
