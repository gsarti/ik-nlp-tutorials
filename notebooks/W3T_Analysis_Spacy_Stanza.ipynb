The same words in a different order can mean something completely different. Even splitting text into useful word-like units can be difficult in many languages. While it’s possible to solve some problems starting from only the raw characters, it’s usually better to use linguistic knowledge to add useful information.

    "Tokenization is the task of splitting a text into meaningful segments, called tokens. The input to the tokenizer is a unicode text, and the output is a Doc object. To construct a Doc object, you need a [Vocab](https://spacy.io/api/vocab) instance, a sequence of word strings, and optionally a sequence of spaces booleans, which allow you to maintain alignment of the tokens into the original string.\n",

    "A Doc object’s sentences are available via the `Doc.sents` property. To view a Doc’s sentences, you can iterate over the `Doc.sents`, a generator that yields `Span` objects. You can check whether a Doc has sentence boundaries by calling `Doc.has_annotation` with the attribute name `\"SENT_START\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other libraries, spaCy uses the dependency parse to determine sentence boundaries. This is usually the most accurate approach, but it requires a **trained pipeline** that provides accurate predictions. If your texts are closer to general-purpose news or web text, this should work well out-of-the-box with spaCy’s provided trained pipelines. For social media or conversational text that doesn’t follow the same rules, your application may benefit from a custom trained or rule-based component."

Tokens exhibiting **polysemy** (i.e. multiple meanings) like `bank` will have all their possible meanings \"crammed\" into a single vector. This is one major limitation of static word vectors, and a reason why **contextualized word vectors** produced by pretrained neural language models, in which each resulting output embedding is generated dynamically depending on the full context, have gained much traction in NLP."

    "## Handling More Languages with Stanza\n",

    "spaCy is a great tool for English, but what if you want to use it for other languages? The good news is that spaCy supports a wide range of languages, but the bad news is that it doesn't support all of them. In this section, we will see how to understand whether a language is supported, and what to do if it isn't.\n",

    "The list of supported languages is available on the [spaCy website](https://spacy.io/usage/models#languages). If no packages are available for the language you are interested in, you can still use spaCy to process text in that language, but you will have to use the `Language` class directly, and you won't be able to use the pre-trained statistical models. This limits the functionality of spaCy, but it is still possible to use it for tokenization, lemmatization, and other basic NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to use the [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) library, which is a Python wrapper for the [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) library. Stanza supports a wide range of languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic (full list [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/available_models.html)). Conveniently, Stanza authors thoroughly report the [performance](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/performance.html) of their models, so you can easily decide whether to use them or not.\n",

    "Stanza `Pipeline` is very similar to spaCy `Language`, and it can be used in a similar way.
